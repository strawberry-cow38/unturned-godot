# Unturned → Godot Port — Progress Log

Plan: UNTURNED_GODOT_PLAN.md (fable-5). Target: Godot 4 (C#/.NET 8, Jolt). Private project.
Approach: translate the readable U3-SDK source; rip Steam assets (AssetRipper) as swappable placeholders.
Repo: C:\claude-workspace\unturned-godot\ (this). Source+plan: C:\claude-workspace\archive\.
Mode (master 2026-07-08): keep moving autonomously, don't stop until commanded; 15m self-pace cron; decide+log, don't ask.

## Phase 0 — Foundations (in progress)
- [x] Prereqs on 4080: .NET 8.0.419, Godot (choco), retail Unturned install present (rip source).
- [x] Workspace + git repo.
- [x] **0b — NetPak (netcode) engine-agnostic: compiles standalone + 46 tests GREEN** (bit/angle/string/
      defer-read/overrun). Thesis proven at logic level. (Steamworks-ex + UnityNetPakTests still deferred.)
- [x] **0b — UnturnedDat (data/mod .dat layer) engine-agnostic: compiles standalone + FULL test suite GREEN
      = 1039 passed / 0 failed** — incl the UnityDatEx (Vector) + UnityDatColorEx (Color32) extensions.
      The modding backbone carries untouched. (InternalsVisibleTo added.)
- [x] **0c — SDG.Compat harness: Mathf + Vector2/3/4 + Quaternion + Color + Color32 shims (namespace
      UnityEngine). PROVEN CORRECT by the game's own UnityDatEx/ColorEx tests passing against them.**
- [x] **TALLY: 1085 tests green standalone** (NetPak 46 + UnturnedDat 1039). The engine-agnostic core carries.
- [ ] Un-defer NetPak UnityNetPakTests (Vector/Quat now available) + Steamworks-ex (needs Steamworks.NET)
- [x] **Godot 4.6.2 mono skeleton BUILDS + RUNS the ported core in-engine.** Headless run proof: NetPak 0xABC r/w True, DatParser parsed (2 keys), Unity->Godot adapter Z-flip (1,2,3)->(1,2,-3). game/ = Godot .NET proj refs SDG.Compat+NetPak+UnturnedDat + GodotCompat adapter + Main smoke node. Jolt physics set.
- [ ] 0a rip station: AssetRipper full rip of the Steam install → canonical ripped/ tree
- [ ] 0d converter v0 + ContentProvider (GLB/PNG passthrough, static-prop YAML→.tscn, GUID manifest)
- [ ] GATE: a ripped prop instantiates in a Godot scene via ContentProvider by its original GUID
